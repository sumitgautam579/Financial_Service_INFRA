# Financial Service Platform Architectural Plan on AWS 
 
 <!-- * Single EC2 (t2.micro) as your “all-in-one” node [for cost optimizations as a learner]

 * Self-managed k3s (lightweight Kubernetes) on EC2

 * Docker Hub (or GitHub Container Registry) for images

 * Jenkins in Kubernetes for CI/CD

 * S3 for object storage (models, uploads)

 * RDS (MySQL) for transactional data

 * Helm to deploy services (Prometheus, Grafana, SonarQube, ELK, NGINX Ingress)

 * Route 53 + ACM for DNS & TLS -->

Here’s a high-level walkthrough of the components and how they fit together to work as Financial Service Platform:

## Networking & Edge

* VPC: Isolates all resources.

* Route 53: DNS for api.example.com, jenkins.example.com, etc.

* CloudFront: CDN in front of the Kubernetes Ingress for low-latency global delivery.

* CloudWatch: Captures EC2 host metrics and logs via the CloudWatch Agent.

## Compute & Orchestration

* EC2 (t2.micro): Single node running k3s (lightweight Kubernetes) and Docker.

* Kubernetes: Hosts all workloads via Helm charts (microservices, Jenkins, monitoring, logging).

* Docker: Container runtime for builds and pods.

* Helm: Manages Kubernetes deployments of every component.

## CI/CD & Code Quality

* Git (GitHub): Source repo for microservices.

* Jenkins:

   * Pulls code on commit (webhook).

   * Runs Maven builds.

   * Executes static analysis: SonarQube, Fortify, AppScan.

   * Builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub.

   * Deploys updated Helm releases to k3s.

## Service Hosting

* Microservices: JBoss-based applications packaged in Docker.

* Ingress Controller: Exposes services via HTTPS (certificates from ACM).

## Data & Storage

* RDS (MySQL): Relational data store for transactions.

* S3: Object storage for model binaries, user uploads; lifecycle policies to move cold data to Glacier.

## Monitoring & Alerting

* Prometheus: Scrapes metrics from pods, JVM, node-exporter.

* Grafana: Dashboards for system, app, and business KPIs.

* Nagios: External health checks of EC2 and public endpoints.

## Logging Pipeline (Fluentd can be repaced using)

* Kafka & Zookeeper: Central log bus that receives app logs via sidecar or client library.

* Kafka Connect: Streams logs from Kafka topics into Elasticsearch.

* Kibana: Log search and visualization with per-tenant access controls.

## Security & Configuration

* IAM: AWS resource permissions, service-linked roles.

* Chef & Ansible:

   * Chef provisions the EC2 instance (Docker, k3s, CloudWatch agent).

   * Ansible orchestrates Kubernetes upgrades, Helm chart updates, and backup tasks.
